# Web Design 💻 Hackathon

Working in pairs or a small group of up to 4 learners. You will choose one of the themes below and create a multi-page website (4 pages minimum). Each member of the team should be responsible for creating at least one page.

## ❤️ Website with a purpose ❤️

Create a website that will raise awareness of a cause that is important to you or your community.

## 📚Educational Website📚

Create a website that will teach other about a particular topic from a specific subject.

You could interview members of staff from a specific department see what they would like or what they think about your idea? You could even embed a game you have made to make it more interactive?

## 💡 Just for Fun💡

Create a project to inform others about a particular event or place.

You could create a fact page on characters from your favourite tv show or film. Or it could be showcasing your local sports team and players or another local club or up and coming show highlighting the cast etc. Or how about showcasing a place and things to do?

# Start Here

Once you have decided the theme of your site:

### ❤️ Website with a purpose ❤️
### 📚Educational Website📚
### 💡 Just for Fun💡

Start by designing your website wireframe or what your website will look like so your team have a plan. You could do this on paper or using a tool like [Mocqups](https://moqups.com/wireframe-tool/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwn4qWBhCvARIsAFNAMih1MgYQvmP_2qnW86DTgX37kXXVTnGswNEnxC3LaTqjjoiIZwu9ElYaAsXvEALw_wcB)

Each member of the team should be responsible for creating at least one page.

### Remember

🐞Everyone gets bugs, this is expected. Use the **code clips** to help you fix the bugs, do one at a time.

🏁Test regularly, run your program and test with each new line.
